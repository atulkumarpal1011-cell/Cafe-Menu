## Problem Statement

Many beginner-level cafe or restaurant management solutions lack simple, interactive systems for taking orders and generating bills. Manual billing often leads to errors in calculations for discounts, service charges, and taxes. This project aims to provide an easy-to-use, automated console-based system that allows customers to place orders, calculate bills accurately, and generate detailed receipts.

## Scope of the Project

The Cafe Ordering System is designed to simulate a restaurant ordering experience in a console environment. It allows users to:

Browse menus by cuisine categories (Indian, Chinese, Italian).

Select multiple items and specify quantities.

Automatically apply discounts, service charges, and GST to the bill.

Generate a clear, detailed receipt.

This project is suitable for small-scale cafes, training purposes, or as a learning tool for beginners in Python programming. Future extensions could include a graphical interface, database integration, or online ordering functionality.

## Target Users

Beginners learning Python programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions.

Small cafes or restaurants looking for a simple billing system.

Students or hobbyists wanting to practice building console-based applications.

## High-Level Features

Categorized menu display (Indian, Chinese, Italian) with item prices.

Interactive ordering system with input validation.

Quantity selection for each item.

Automatic calculation of subtotal, bulk discounts (10% for orders above Rs. 3500), service charges (10%), and GST (18%).

Detailed final receipt showing itemized costs, discounts, taxes, and grand total.

Friendly console prompts with error handling for invalid inputs.
